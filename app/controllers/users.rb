# == Users Controller
# Standard REST resource representing users in the system.  The 
# semantics of this are a bit nonstandard as this resource really 
# represents "active" users only - the only ones that matter as far 
# as the gaming system is concerned.
# 
# Also, although this is not a singular resource, this is effectively 
# a "singleton resource" of current - can only be invoked with an 
# id of "current".  The only exception is the show action which allows 
# you to see details about any user.
