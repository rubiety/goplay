# == Game Board
# Represents a Go game board and implements all of the rules 
# of go as well as maintains the state of the board as the game 
# progresses.  This state is seralized and deserialized into the 
# database for quick processing.
# 
# This class is somewhat coupled to +Game+ but I decided to use 
# composition rather than just bloating up the Game class with 
# excess Go-specific logic.

  class MoveTargetExistsError < InvalidMoveError; end
  
  # The "Rule of Ko" in Go is implemented to prevent repetitive situations 
  # from arising in certain circumstances.
  class RuleOfKoError < InvalidMoveError; end
  
  # A suicidal move, or one that will result in that stone being immediately 
  # captured, is not allowed.
  class SuicidalMoveError < InvalidMoveError; end
