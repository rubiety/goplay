# == Game Move
# Represents a single move by a user in a game.  Stores
# coordinates of the move in +row+ and +column+ fields.  Related 
# to a move is the concept of a +Capture+. 
# 
# === Move Logic
# Actual game logic of move handling is handled by the +Board+ class
# of which +Game+ is a composition.  Handling of this is invoked through 
# a after_create callback which tries to make the move on the board and 
# creates the necessary related +Capture+ objects.
# 
# === Remote Event Spawning
# A remote move event is spawned automatically by the +spawn_event+ 
# after_create callback.
