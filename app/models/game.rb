# == Game
# Implements a game.  Each game has a +white_player+ and a +black_player+ 
# as well as an associated board size specified when creating the game 
# (as Go can be played with whatever board size you want).
# 
# === Game States
# In order to keep track of status as the game progresses,
# a basic status system is in place in which the status 
# field is expected to be updated to the following values in the 
# following order:
# 
# * Created
# * Invited
# * Accepted
# * In-Progress
# * Completed
# 
# When a game is completed, +completed_status+ may be one of three values:
# 
# * Win - game was a win, player determined by +white_won?+.
# * Draw - game was a draw with a tied store.
# * Cancelled - game was cancelled by a user leaving the game or logging 
#   out prematurely.
# 
# === Remote Event Spawning
# Remove +Event+ objects are spawned automatically through the +spawn_invite_event+ 
# callback.  
# 
# === Board State
# A two-dimentional array of board state is stored to avoid having to reconstruct 
# board state from moves on every request.  This array is stored in a YAML-serialized 
# field +board_state+.
